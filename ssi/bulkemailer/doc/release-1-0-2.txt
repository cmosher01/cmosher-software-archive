Bulk Emailer V1.0.2 Release Notes

1. OPE #1257: Proper alignments to the columns on the job and history pages are set. For example, columns containing numbers (size, sent, bad, etc) are now right justified.

2. OPE #1263: The job priority levels and hold status now retain their values after system restarts. Previously, when the system exited (shutdown, crash, etc), all job priority levels and hold status of running jobs would be lost and their values reset to the default values upon startup.  

3. OPE #1271: The job history is written to a CSV file. The fields in this file are separated by commas and are similar to the fields on the history page. One CSV file will be created each month and placed in the log directory.
Directory: /usr/www/webuser/bulkemailer/log/
File name: HistYYYYMM.csv, where YYYY=4 digit year and MM=2 digit month.
The data fields written to file are:
job name,id,size,sent,bad,sent per minute(e/m),state,start date(mm/dd/yyyy),start time(hh:mm),end date(mm/dd/yyyy),end time(hh:mm),proc time(hh:mm:ss),elap time(hh:mm:ss)

4. OPE #1273: Created a stats page that has some statistics about the current state of the Bulk Emailer.  Currently displays the start date and the up time.

5. OPE #1290: Put a start time column on the jobs page.

6. OPE #1293: The job name and ID are now included in the job log.

7. Fixed Shipper exit status on failures.

8. OPE #1279: When the Bulk Emailer is shut down and restarted, it will save and restore the state of the MTAs (the number of messages sent out during the last hour).

9. OPE #1280: The checkpoint file for a job now contains throughput history. So when the Bulk Emailer is shut down and restarted, jobs' throughput maximums will be remembered.

10. OPE #1059: The throughput maximum rate for jobs is now precise. Previously, the maximum rate was just approximate, and had an error on the order 1000 messages, so specifying a rate of 20 messages per hour did not work. Now, any rate specified will work exactly, with no error.

11. OPE #1260: Allow the maximum throughput rate to specified in messages per DAY, in addition to messages per hour.
