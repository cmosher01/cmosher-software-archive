use bitmap join indexes:
CREATE BITMAP INDEX PanIncome
ON PanelistHHMember(Panelist.incomeRangeID)
FROM PanelistHHMember, Panelist
WHERE Panelist.panelistID = PanelistHHMember.panelistID

Will this work?
CREATE BITMAP INDEX PanGeo
ON Panelist(PanGeo.geoID)
FROM Panelist, PanGeo
WHERE PanGeo.panelistID = Panelist.panelistID


denormalize panelist and ethnicattrib: b,w,a,h,i,p,o (columns in panelist)

restrict to USA?

restrict to active panelists

denormalize panelist and geoplacement
denormalize panelist and HH member

(denormalize panelist, geoplacement, HHmember, ethnic into one
table, then full parallel scan of any count but xdem would be ~20 secs.)
