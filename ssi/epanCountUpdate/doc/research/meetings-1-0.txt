Discussed running the PanelistSummary Creation routine as a "recurring job" in
the existing Epanel Job Scheduling system. Danny recommended that this was the
preferred mechanism, to the alternatives of an ISG-controlled cron job or otherwise.
The main reason for this is that the job would be under our control in this scenario.

The recurring job submission merely creates a normal job entry at the scheduled time.
Therefore the PanelistSummaryCreation job would run like any other job type we are
familiar with (such as a pull or a shipment).

The PanelistSummaryCreation SQL commands could be run from a Java program via JDBC,
rather than via SQL*Plus.

Discussed the internal specifications for Phase I, the database back end (epanCountUpdate
process).

We discussed that there would be many advantages to having the new PanelistSummary table
is its own schema, rather than in the DA_PROD (or QC) schema. The epanCountUpdate process
would log in to the database as that user. The role SSI_Email_Count_Update should be
created and used for the epanUpdateCount process to access the needed data from DA_PROD.
It was thought that perhaps the access was need to be granted directly to the user
rather than just to the role, but that was subsequently presumed not to be true.

Suggestions for the new schema and user names: COUNT and COUNTQC.
[Personal note: maybe EPANCOUNT and EPANCOUNTQC, because project names are epanCountXxx]

Since there will be a new user dedicated to this update process, that user's default
tablespace can be used; the SQL commands run by the update process will not have
tablespace clauses.

Doug suggested that the SQL commands run by the update process should not need to specify
values for initial extent allocation; Oracle should be able to manage this automatically.

The program should be set to run at 3:18 AM on Mondays.

The log file for the process will show each step running with a timestamp. No other
information was suggested to be written to the log file.
