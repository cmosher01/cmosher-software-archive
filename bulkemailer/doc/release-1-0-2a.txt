Close file in saveBuckets. This bug was causing the file to be
left open (actually the file would be closed at garbage
collection time, but this is unreliable) and eventually
(after about 5 days of running, in this particular scenario)
having too many open files. The following error messages were
being written to the log file: "Error trying to save the MTA
state" and "(Too many open files)"
