<h3>Getting Started</h3>
The first time you run GRO, you can either create a new empty gedcom file,
or open an existing one. If you create a new empty tree (menu: File/New),
you can add individuals by choosing the menu Edit/New Individual, or by
right-clicking on the chart and choosing New Individual.
<p />
<h4>Import Existing Data</h4>
Alternatively, if you have your family tree data in another
program, you can try to export it from that program in GEDCOM format (remember
where you save it!). Then open that exported file using GRO (menu: File/Open...).
<h4>Drop-Line Chart</h4>
<p />The first time you open a GEDCOM file, the individuals will automatically
be positioned on the drop-line chart, but they will probably not be very well
organized. So the first task you may want to perform is to move the
individuals around (by clicking and dragging them) and clean up the chart.
(Note: if you have the DEMO version of GRO, remember you CAN'T SAVE any
of your changes, so don't do too much work. Of course the
full version of GRO lets you save changes.)
<h4>Individual</h4>
<p />You can double-click on an individual to open up a new window that lets
you modify their genealogical information. Their name is shown in bold;
press the "name" button to edit the person's name (use slashes around the
surname). Use the gender button to edit their gender (male, female, or unknown).
Events and attributes are shown in
different lists (use the tabs to switch between them). 
To add an event or
attribute to the person, double-click on &lt;new event&gt; or &lt;new
attribute&gt;. To edit an existing one, just double-click the row.
The other two
tabs are Ancestors which shows a pedigree list-control, and Partnerships
which lists the individual's spouses and children.
<h4>Events and Attributes</h4>
Choose the type of the event from the drop-down list. Enter the date by
pressing the date button and entering the date information (for normal
dates, choose "exact date", choose the month, and enter the day and year,
and click OK). Enter the place the event happened (include address if
known, city, county, state, and country). The citation button allows you
to cite the source of the event information. You can also enter any notes
about the event you want.
<h4>Partnerships</h4>
This tab (on the individual window) lists all spouses (or partners) of
the individual. For each spouse, it lists all "partnership events" (like
marriage or engagement) followed by all children (from that partnership).
(Note: you cannot add parters or children from this page, yet. For now,
you go to the drop-line chart and add a new individual, then connect them.)
<h4>Citations and Sources</h4>
The citation dialog allows you to enter or modify information about a
single citation. The citation is basically a page from a source. A
source is a book, gravestone, census, newspaper, birth certificate,
or other document where you got the information from. The citation
is the exact page in the source where the information is located.
<p />
When entering a new citation, you can either choose an existing source
(if you already entered it earlier) or add a new source. Click on the
source button to do this. The source information is author, title, and
publication information, as well as a repository (library or other
building) where you found the source. Again, if you already entered the
repository into the system earlier, you can just pick it from the list,
otherwise you must enter a new one. The source dialog also has a place
you can enter the actual text from the source document. This can be used
to enter the entire text of a will, birth certificate, or any other
text directly from the source document. Note that when you do enter
text here, be sure to enter it exactly as it was in the original document.
Don't interpret the data when entering it here. For example,
if the document says "3/1/26" then you should enter 3/1/26, not 1 Mar. 1926.
If you want to add you own comment in the text, be sure to surround them
with brackets [like this].
<p />
The author and title should be entered in their entirety from the title page if possible.
For sources that aren't books, you should describe the source as
fully as possible. For example, a birth certificate could be entered like this: 
author: "Division of Vital Statistics, Department of Health, New York, USA"
title: "Certificate of death; Smith, John; Number 9226".
Publication information should include the publisher, city, and year for
published sources. For unpublished sources, enter the date the source
was created, and the place it is located.
<p />In general, when citing a source, try to be as complete
as possible when describing it. The idea is that anybody else who
reads the citation information you enter should be able to locate
the same exact source by themselves.
<p />The citation also contains a field called quality. This is a
rough estimate of the reliability of the source, how well it can
probably be trusted. Birth certificates, for example, are direct
evidence of births. On the other hand, a newspaper article may
by secondary evidence. Or you may be refering to a published genealogy
that you know has many errors, so you might mark that source as
unreliable.
<h3>More Details</h3>
<h4>Drop-Line Chart</h4>
You can use the drop-line chart to add new people to your tree.
When you add a new person and enter his information (and close
the window), you will want to "connect" him to an existing
person on the tree. For example, assume you already have John Smith
on the chart. Through your research, you find out that his father
is James Smith. You'll add James Smith to the tree, and then you'll
want to <i>connect</i> him to John Smith. To do this
select BOTH people (click on one person, then shift-click on
the second person) and right-click (on the second person) and
choose "Connect". This will bring up a dialog asking you how
these two people are related. Choose the correct relationship
and click OK. That's all there is to it! (Note that you must
enter the <i>gender</i> of <i>parents</i> before you connect them; this is
necessary because the GEDCOM standard needs to know whether
to give the person a HUSBAND or WIFE tag in the family.)
<h4>Pedigree Chart</h4>
From the drop-line chart window, you can right-click on a person
and choose "View Pedigree" (or click the pedigree tool bar button)
and it will open up a new window with that person's pedigree.
You can open a pedigree for any person in your tree. Once you are
on the pedigree window, you can resize the window to change
the size of the chart, and you can type + or - (plus or minus)
on the keyboard to change the number of generations displayed
on the chart.
<h4>Index</h4>
You can choose from the menu: View, Index of Individuals to open
up a new window that lists all the individuals in your tree. The
list shows surname, given name, birth date, and death date. Click
on a list heading if you want to sort the list by that item.
Double-click on a person to open that individual's dialog.
<h4>List of Sources</h4>
The toolbar has a button with a book icon on it that opens a new
window listing all the sources in the tree (sorted by title).
Double-click a source to bring up the dialog that allows you to change
it (or delete it).
<h4>Dates and Calendars</h4>
GRO's date entry dialog allows you to be very specific about the
dates you enter in your genealogy. You can specify any date as
either an exact date, an approximate date, a range of possible dates,
or as a period (span) of time. You enter two dates to specify
a period of time, and GRO will automatically calculate the
number of days long the period is.
<p />
The date entry dialog can also be a very useful
tool in your research. It allows the usual entry of month, day,
and year. Also, it allows you to enter years BC if you so desire.
It automatically calculates the day of the week for any exact date
you enter.
<p />
The date dialog also allows you to specify the calendar (Julian or
Gregorian) of the date, and it allows you to convert between the
two calendars.
<p />
The Gregorian calendar is the calendar in normal use in the United
States of America today. It was first adopted at different times by
different countries; the English colonies adoped it in September
1752. The calendar in use before that was called the Julian
calendar (sometimes called "Old Style" or "O.S.", versus
"New Style" or "N.S." for the Gregorian calendar).
When you enter a date with the Gregorian button chosen, GRO
assumes it to be Gregorian; if you then click the Julian
button, GRO will convert it to the same day on the Julian
calendar.
<p />
Another change to the calendar occurred in September 1752
as well. The beginning of the year was changed from March
25 to the more familiar January 1. It was this March 25
New Year's Day that led to the "slashed year" (for example "Feb 9, 1749/50")
that can be found in many old records. This can led to
much confusion in your research if you're not careful.
The best bet is to interpret slashed years using the
<b>second</b> year shown.
For example, treat 9 Feb 1749/50 as 9 Feb 1750.
<p />

Or see the <a href="http://www.tondering.dk/claus/calendar.html" target="_top">Calendar FAQ</a>.
<h4>Holidays</h4>
Have you ever asked yourself a question like "On what date did Easter fall in 1837?" GRO can help
answer this type of question. GRO can determine the date of
many common holidays in any given year. Choose from the menu Tools,
Holidays. Enter the year and pick the holiday; GRO will
calculate the date of the holiday.
