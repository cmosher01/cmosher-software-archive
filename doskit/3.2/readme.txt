original32sysmasstd.nib & .d13
original32sysmaspls.nib & .d13
	original nibble images downloaded from asimov, and denibblized versions;
	DOS 3.2 System Master--Standard and
	DOS 3.2 System Master--Plus

stock32init.nib & .d13
	nibble image exactly as created by DOS 3.2 INIT command  (in emulator),
	and de-nibblized version

stock32mastercreated.nib & .d13

	and de-nibblized version



clean32sysmasstd.d13 & .nib
	Used apple2src to build DOS 3.2 onto disk (apple2src/build/dos/dos3X/dos320/dos.d13 & .nib)
	into T$0S$0-T$2S$A (no HELLO program name)
	Built with VERSION=320 and NODELAY
	Valid catalog track $11 (no files, all sectors free except T$0S$0-T$2S$A, T$11)
	zeroes elsewhere (no I/O errors)
	volume #254
	Copied (using Copy ][ Plus 5.5) all files from original DOS 3.2 System Master--Standard,
	except for "UPDATE 3.2" because that's alread on the Plus disk, below, and because it
	doesn't fit onto a standard volume
	Note that the original Standard disk devotes some of the usused catalog sectors on
	track $11 to storing parts of files; this disk doesn't do that.
	Boots HELLO program.

clean32sysmaspls.d13 & .nib
	Similar to clean32sysmasstd, but with all files from DOS 3.2 System Master--Plus
