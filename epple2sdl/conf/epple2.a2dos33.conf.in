# After power-on, type C600G to boot the DOS 3.3 System Master disk.
# Notice it shows "APPLE II STANDARD" for this machine, and then it
# loads APPLESOFT into the language card.
#
# You can use FP to switch to Applesoft, and INT to switch
# back to Integer BASIC. As you do this, notice the "R" reading
# indicator on the language card line turning on or off.
