epple2, the Emulated aPPLE ][

See INSTALL for instructions on building and installing a
normal distribution.

epple2 is an emulator of the Apple ][ and Apple ][ plus
computers from Apple, Inc. It strives to faithfully simulate
much of the internal workings of the original Apple ][,
including the individual cycles of the 6502 CPU, and the
NTSC video signal generation, including the "strange orange
line", other color anomalies, and the "floating data bus."
The CPU and video timings are synchronized, and the emulator
is designed to run at the same speed as the original
machine (if your computer is fast enough). It also emulates
several different types of television screens and monitors
for the display.

It includes emulation of a Disk ][ controller card, a ROM
firmware card, and a RAM "Language" card, as well as a
simple clock card.

epple2 is written in C++, and is designed to be buildable
Windows (with Cygwin or Visual C++ 6.0) or Linux (gcc).

The SDL library (http://www.libsdl.org) is the only dependency
of epple2 (see below).



RUNNING
-------
SDL:
To run epple2, you need to have the SDL libraries installed.
See http://www.libsdl.org for information on SDL.
You'll need to download and install the "Runtime Libraries"
for your platform (Win32 or Linux).

ROM:
With epple2 and SDL, you can run the emulator, but it won't
do too much without the appropriate Apple ROM code. You can
use ROM images from your own original Apple ][ (plus), or
you can find some on the Internet (check the Asimov Apple
repository).
Alternatively, you can build the ROMs yourself from assembly
language source files I've created; these are available in
the apple2src project. (See that project for details).

Disks:
You will also probably want floppy disk images. Again, you can
download some from the Internet, especially from Asimov. The
epple2 only reads NIBBLE IMAGES. If you only have DOS images,
you will need to comvert them to nibble images; you can use
CiderPress (http://ciderpress.sourceforge.net) for this.

BUILDING
--------
If you want to build epple2 from the source distribution,
you'll need to have the SDL development libraries installed.
See http://www.libsdl.org for information on SDL.
You'll need to download and install the "Development Libraries"
for your platform (Win32 or Linux).

Developers fetching from the subversion directly should
execute the bootstrap script first.



PLATFORM-SPECIFIC BUILDING
--------------------------

Windows/Cygwin
--------------
Install Cygwin. You'll need the Base Cygwin packages, of course,
as well as the following (under Devel):
automake
autoconf
binutils
gcc-g++
make

Install SDL. At http://www.libsdl.org/ find the download page.
Download the "Development Libraries" for Win32, mingw, for example:
SDL-devel-1.2.13-mingw32.tar.gz (Mingw32)
And save it to your home directory (for cygwin).
Untar the SDL archive to your home directory:
$ cd
$ tar xzvf SDL-devel-1.2.13-mingw32.tar.gz
Then follow the instructions to install SDL, for example:
$ cd SDL-1.2.13
$ make native



From the Cygwin bash prompt, go to your home directory and
untar the epple2 source distribution tar file and cd to the
epple2 directory. For example:
$ cd
$ tar xzvf epple2-1.0.tar.gz
$ cd epple2

NOTE: If you checked out epple2 from subversion, rather
than downloading the distribution, you need to first run
the bootstrap script:
$ ./bootstrap



Then build as follows:
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install

Then follow the instruction above under "RUNNING" for ROM and disks.
