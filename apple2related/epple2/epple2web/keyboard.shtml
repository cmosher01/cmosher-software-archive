				<h3>Epple ][ Keyboard</h3>
<p>
The EPPLE ][ emulates the original Apple ][ keyboard. The original Apple ][
keyboard had symbols in different places than current common PC keyboards. For
example, Shift-2 on the Apple ][ produces a double quote, but on a PC keyboard
it produces an at-sign. For ease of typing, the EPPLE ][ emulator does not
mimic the positions of the original keys, but rather mimics the symbols on
the current PC keyboard. So, for example, if you type Shift-2 on the PC
keyboard into the EPPLE ][, it produces an at-sign, as you would normally expect.
</p>
<p>
The Apple ][ keyboard didn't produce lower-case letters; neither does the emulator.
Also, the Apple couldn't produce an opening square bracket ([), braces, vertical
bar, backslash. There were no up- or down-arrow keys. You cannot type these into
the emulator, either. There are other, unusual, cases that are emulated correctly,
as well, such as typing Control in conjunction with a number key simply produces
that number. So typing a Control-3 is the same as just typing a 3. Also, typing
Shift-Control-2 produces the NUL character (ASCII $80).
</p>
<p>
The Apple ][ keyboards didn't automatically repeat typing characters when a
key was held down. Instead, the user would hold down the REPT ("repeat") key
while holding down the key that was to be repeated. On the EPPLE ][, this
behavior is emulated, and the F10 key is used as the REPT key.
</p>
<p>
The Apple ][ had no keyboard buffer (actually, it had a buffer of one character).
So if you typed several characters on the keyboard before the currently running
program had a chance to read them, they would get lost (only the final character
typed would be remembered). This behavior can be
toggled on or off in the EPPLE ][. By default, the EPPLE ][ will buffer up any
characters you type and deliver them to the emulated machine when it asks for
them. However, the Apple program must be written properly to allow this to work.
Some Apple ][ programs (like maybe some games) may not work correctly in this
respect, so you may want to turn off buffering in these cases. With buffering
turned off, the EPPLE ][ accurately emulates the original Apple ][. Use the F12
key to toggle the keyboard buffering. Note that pasting from the clipboard (with
the Insert key) will most definitely cause keys to be lost if the keyboard
buffer is turned off. So if you have a big Applesoft program in the clipboard
and you want to paste it into the EPPLE ][ correctly, make sure the keyboard
buffer is on.
