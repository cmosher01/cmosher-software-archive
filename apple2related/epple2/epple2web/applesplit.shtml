				<h3>Video tricks from Bishop's Apple Split</h3>
				<p>
					<img class="ss" src="applesplit.png" /><br />
				</p>
				<p>
					The October 1982 issue of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softalk">Softalk</a>
					featured an article by Bob Bishop entitled
					"<a href="http://rich12345.tripod.com/aiivideo/softalk.html">Have an Apple Split</a>," which describes
					in some detail the inner workings of the Apple ]['s video processing. Listings 1 and 2 from that
					article show a short Applesoft program and assembly language subroutine that allow the Apple ][
					to have a screen split between text and graphics display. To achieve this on the EPPLE ][,
					copy the following text and paste it into the emulator (at the Applesoft "]" prompt). Since the
					EPPLE ][ accurately emulates the video scanning and timing of the original Apple ][s, this
					"split screen" technique works successfully.
					The rest of the behavior described in the article (the floating data bus) is also emulated
					faithfully by the EPPLE ][.
