clean31sysmas_stock_rawdos.d13 & .nib
	Used apple2src to build DOS 3.1 onto disk (apple2src/build/dos/dos3X/dos310/dos.d13 & .nib)
	into T$0S$0-T$2S$A (no HELLO program name)
	Built with VERSION=310 and NODELAY
	Valid catalog track $11 (no files, all sectors free except T$0S$0-T$2S$A, T$11)
	zeroes elsewhere (no I/O errors)
	volume #254
	Copied (using Copy ][ Plus 5.5) all files from original DOS 3.1 System Master.
	Renamed HELLO to normal characters instead of inverse.
	Boots HELLO program.
	Locked all files.
	Fixed file sizes.
	Note that the RAWDOS file on this disk is the stock RAWDOS file, so if you use
	MASTER CREATE from this disk to create a new disk, that new disk will have the
	stock DOS on it, not the clean built version.
