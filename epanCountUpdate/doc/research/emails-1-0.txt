Use tablespace SUMMARY  there is 1.17 GB free right now.  I will give it more space if needed once the database backup finishes.

User CHRISM has 2GB quota on SUMMARY

  Yes. CHRISM for now. (DA_PROD ultimately, but you don't have to worry about that yet.)

    I'd like to perform some feasibility studies for the new Epanel Count System project I'm working on. I've done some initial timing tests on DEV, but these results aren't truly representative of the behavior on SPOT, due to differences in hardware, OS, Oracle configuration, etc. Since speed is one of the most important goals of this project, I'd like run some timing tests on SPOT.

    According to my estimation, the test should require about 1 GB of data (table and indexes). Is this amount of space available for me? If so, what tablespace should I use?

    Thank you,
