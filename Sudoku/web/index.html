Howard Garns invented "Number Place," today known as Sudoku.
</p>
<p>
I wrote the HowardGarns program to replace pencil and paper (and eraser)
while you solve Sudoku puzzles.
</p>
<p>
You can
<a href="http://mosher.mine.nu/howardgarns/howardgarns.jnlp">execute HowardGarns</a>,
through Java Web Start. You should receive a warning that my certificate is untrusted,
because it is self-signed. Sun may also need to download the latest version of Java.
</p>
<p>
The HowardGarns program is Open Source, and is hosted at SourceForge.
See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/howardgarns/">HowardGarns project page</a>.

<h2>Simple Instructions</h2>
<h3>New Puzzle</h3>
<p>
Use File/New to enter the numbers for the puzzle you want to solve. Puzzles are not generated
by the program; you need to get them from some other source.
</p>
<p>
Here is a simple puzzle to get you started. Just select the numbers below, Ctrl-C to copy, then
run the program, Ctrl-N for New, and Ctrl-V to paste.
</p>
<pre>
100000239
204000000
003506400
040002160
680300002
009800007
000209600
060000005
408000900
</pre>
<p>
You should look at other web sites for games in this easy text format, so you can just
copy and paste. Otherwise, you can manually enter the numbers for each square, using
zero for the empty squares. (You will be entering 81 numbers.)
</p>
<h3>Possibilities</h3>
<p>
Each square on the board shows the remaining possibilities for that square. Left-click to
eliminate a possiblity after you have logically determined that that number cannot appear
in that square. Alternatively, right-click on a possibility to affirm that that square
does indeed contain that number.
</p>
<h3>Rote Solving Assistants</h3>
<p>
The Solve menu lets you have the program do some of the rote logical patterns, such as
eliminating possibilities from the same row, column, or box as an already identified answer.
The different solvers are listed under the Solve menu; you can check the ones you want to
have enabled, and uncheck the ones you want turned off.
There are two ways to have the program solve for you: manually or automatically, which
you can choose at the top of the Solve menu.
<p>
Manually means that you choose "Solve" from the solve menu when you want the program to
apply the (check-marked) solution patterns.
</p>
<p>
Automatically means that the program will apply them after every move you make. Note that
this may lead to some confusing results, in which case you may want to try turning off the
automatic solving.
</p>
<h3>Undo and Redo</h3>
<p>
The program provides undo and redo support, under the Edit menu. You can undo all your
previous moves, or redo them again up to any point.
</p>
<h3>Saving and Resuming</h3>
<p>
You can use File/Save, Save As..., and Open..., to save and resume the puzzle. All your moves
are saved, from the initial puzzle state up to the current state of the puzzle. The file
is a text file. Each move also has the time the move was made saved with it.
