Howard Garns invented "Number Place," today known as Sudoku.
</p>
<p>
I wrote the HowardGarns program to replace pencil and paper (and eraser)
while you solve Sudoku puzzles.

You can
<a href="http://mosher.mine.nu/howardgarns/howardgarns.jnlp">execute HowardGarns</a>,
through Java Web Start. You should receive a warning that my certificate is untrusted,
because it is self-signed. Sun may also need to download the latest version of Java.
</p>
<p>
The HowardGarns program is Open Source, and is hosted at SourceForge.
See the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/howardgarns/">HowardGarns project page</a>.
