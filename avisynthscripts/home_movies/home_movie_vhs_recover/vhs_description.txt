Nancy had a VHS tape of our home movies made in the 1980's sometime, say 1985 or 1986.
At that time, she had put masking tape with numbers on each film.
When I got the films from Mom (Linda) in 2005, there were only 25 films.
These I sent to film-to-video.com to make into DV tape and DVD copies.
Nancy's numbers go up to 28, so there are at least 3 films missing from my DVDs.

This is a list of the films on Nancy's tape, where the film numbers are from the
sequence they appear on the DVD (in dvd_description.txt), which is not entirely
chronological.

Therefore:
There is one film on my DVDs (#6) that isn't on Nancy's video tape.
There are 4 films on Nancy's video tape that aren't on my DVDs (older ones).
Neither the DVDs or the tape are in strict chronological order.

After making the tape, Nancy had it for a while. She gave it to Dad (Barry)
who held on to it for years. Dad gave it to me in 2005.
The tape itself is a Maxell T-127 VHS tape, with black case. The front of the
tape is labelled "Time 1:23:21 CHRIS/NANCY WHEN SMALL" (written by Barry),
and the spine is labelled "MOSHER HOME MOVIES" (by me, Chris).
