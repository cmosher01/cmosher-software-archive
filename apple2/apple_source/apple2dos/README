This directory contains 6502 assembly source files to build the
Apple ][ Disk Operating System, most commonly known as DOS 3.3.

This file is intended for The www.cc65.org Assembler.
It can be assembled with a command line such as:

ca65 -t apple2 -o dos332.obj -D VERSION=332 dos33.a65

This file can build any of the following versions of Apple ][ DOS,
by defining the corresponding label:

version       release date   define VERSION as:
DOS 3.1       1978-07-20     310
DOS 3.2       1979-02-16     320
DOS 3.2.1     1979-07-31     321
DOS 3.3 (0)   1980-08-25     330
DOS 3.3 (1)   1983-01-01     331
DOS 3.3 (2)   1983-08-??     332

Alternatively, you can define FRANKLIN to get
the Franklin Ace version of DOS 3.3

In addition, you can define NODELAY (for any version)
to remove the disk drive delay sections of code. The
resulting image will not work on real Apple's, but
should work in most emulators, and will speed up disk
access (read, write, arm seek).




The original version appears to have come from a set of disks
entitled "DOS Anatomy," from Windsor Scientific, Ltd.

017- How many 'official' versions of DOS 3.3 are there
and how can I tell which is running?

According to The Dostalk Scrapbook, there are 3 official (as in Apple made
'em, I think) versions of DOS 3.3.  PEEK (46725) supposedly tells you which is
running:

165: oldest  (1980)
186: better  (January 1, 1983)
182: latest  (?)

I remember one had something to do with the way text files are handled.

From: Dave Althoff

The second version would be the IIe release ("DOS 3.3e") which contains yet another
APPEND patch, and an additional bit of code which shuts off the 80-column
firmware during boot. That version comes on a new System Master which uses the
LOADER.OBJ0 program to fast-load INTBASIC (or FPBASIC), and a revised "HELLO"
program which displays the "BE SURE CAPS LOCK IS DOWN" reminder on a IIe.

From: Rubywand and Olcott

One big problem with DOS 3.3e is that it uses some memory in the DOS area which
the 1980 release leaves alone. This means it can not be safely patched with Beagle's
"Prontodos" speed-up mods.

With the newer DOS,  you get an APPEND patch (which turns out to introduce a new
APPEND bug),  a few IIe display frills, and a DOS which is _much_ slower than the 1980
DOS 3.3 patched for Prontodos.






















From Apple Assembly Line, Vol. 3, Issue 12, Sept. 1983:

Yet Another New Version of DOS 3.3 	Bob Sander-Cederlof

In the July issue of AAL I outlined the changes Apple made to DOS 3.3 early this year.
Today I received a new "Developer's System Master", with a cover letter claiming another
correction to the APPEND routine. The letter binds developers to begin using the new
version no later than November 1st.

If you like APPEND, or would like to like it, you might want to make these patches in
your own system master. I am going to assume you already have the "early 1983" version,
either because you bought a //e or a disk drive this year, or you copied one from a friend,
or you made the patches from my July article. Here are the new changes:

"early 1983"                August, 1983
---------------------      -----------------------
B683:4C 84 BA JMP $BA84    B683:4C B3 B6 JMP $B6B3

$B6B3-B6CE:ALL ZEROES      B6B3:AD BD B5 LDA $B5BD
                           B6B6:8D E6 B5 STA $B5E6
                           B6B9:8D EA B5 STA $B5EA
                           B6BC:AD BE B5 LDA $B5BE
                           B6BF:8D E7 B5 STA $B5E7
                           B6C2:8D EB B5 STA $B5EB
                           B6C5:8D E4 B5 STA $B5E4
                           B6C8:BA       TSX
                           B6C9:8E 9B B3 STX $B39B
                           B6CC:4C 7F B3 JMP $B37F

$BA84-BA93:PATCH           BA84-BA93:ALL ZEROES

What Apple has done is move the patch they had put at $BA84 down to $B6B3 and added four
extra lines to that patch. I HOPE IT IS NOW CORRECT!













Chris Mosher's observations:
Location $B685 is in the boot sector, T$00, S$00,
and is the high byte of the address of a JMP instruction.
Values are as follows
From the first part, values in hex:
1980: $A5
1983: $BA
1986: $B6

According to the above list, then, the original source code
would be for the last version, shown as "latest" or "1986".
This is consistent with the fact that I found a disk
image documented as being the "last" version of DOS 3.3,
never officially released but available through some
Nibble magazine #47, in 1986. On that boot
image, the JMP instruction jumps to $36B3, the high
order byte being $36, which upon load is fixedup to $B6.
But note the comment from "Apple Assembly Line" above indicating
this version was actually officially released in Aug. 1983.

Here is the relevant section of code:

CLRAPFLG   LDA #0
           STA APPNDFLG
           .IF VERSION = 330
               JMP BK2APND
           .ELSEIF VERSION = 331
               JMP CMPATCH
           .ELSEIF VERSION = 332
               JMP RSETPTRS
           .ENDIF
