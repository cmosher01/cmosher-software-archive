=== Paddles

The Epple ][ provides two paddles to the Apple ][ machine.
One paddle is controlled by moving the mouse left and right; the other
paddle is controlled by moving the mouse up and down. The paddle buttons
are emulated by the mouse buttons (left and right click).

In
http://www.scribd.com/doc/201423/Understanding-the-Apple-II-by-Jim-Sather-1983Quality-Software[Understanding the Apple II],
on page 7-33, Jim Sather describes soldering fixed resistors across a game connector
to create two real-time clock references. This is emulated by the Epple ][. Paddle timers 2 and 3
are 100-microsecond and 1-millisecond references, respectively.
