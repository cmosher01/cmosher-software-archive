=== Speaker

The Apple ][ could generate sound via a speaker that generated square wave
audio. A program could read memory location $C030 to toggle the speaker and
generate a ``click'' sound.

The Epple ][ emulator will generate sounds from the emulated Apple and
send them to the audio device. It generates 8-bit mono sound, with a 22,050 Hz
sampling rate.
