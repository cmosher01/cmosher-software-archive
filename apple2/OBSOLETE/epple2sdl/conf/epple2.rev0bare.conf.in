# Apple ][ with revision zero motherboard
#
# This sets up a revision zero motherboard, and loads
# Integer BASIC and the old Monitor ROMs. This set up
# has nothing in any slots; it's a minimalist Apple ][.
#
# With a revision zero motherboard, powering on the machine
# doesn't start it running; you need to press RESET (Break)
# to get it actually running.



# Load Integer BASIC and old Monitor ROMs
import motherboard rom 1000 $(PREFIX)lib/apple2/system/intbasic/intbasic.ex65
import motherboard rom 2425 $(PREFIX)lib/apple2/system/other/other.ex65
import motherboard rom 2800 $(PREFIX)lib/apple2/system/monitor/apple2/monitor.ex65



# Use an original, revision zero, motherboard
