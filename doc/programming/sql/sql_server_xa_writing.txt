SQL Server writing

When writing on live database:
1. write change to buffer
2. write change to log
3. flush buffer to disk
4. write checkpoint to log

When (re)starting database:
1. start reading log at end
2. read changes in the log back to the last checkpoint
2. if change is on disk, undo
