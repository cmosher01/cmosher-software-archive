APPLE ][ Source Code

This directory contains assembly language source code to
build Apple ][ firmware and DOS 3.3 images.

These sources are built using the cc65 assembler (http://www.cc65.org).

Windows
-------
To build the apple sources under Windows, download and install cc65.

Download and run cc65-2.12.0-1.exe (or the latest version).
Leave the default installation directory: C:\Program Files\cc65
You don't need all the supported platforms, so you should choose
"Custom" installation, and uncheck all options except for
"Apple ][ specific files"
Choose to add cc65 to PATH, lib, and include.
