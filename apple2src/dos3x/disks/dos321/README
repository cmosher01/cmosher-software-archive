original321sysmasstd.nib & .d13
original321sysmaspls.nib & .d13
	original nibble images (from Linards Ticmanis), and denibblized versions;
	DOS 3.2.1 System Master--Standard and
	DOS 3.2.1 System Master--Plus

stock321init.nib & .d13
	nibble image exactly as created by DOS 3.2.1 INIT command  (in emulator),
	and de-nibblized version

stock321mastercreated.nib & .d13
	as above, but then run UPDATE 3.2.1 program to make it a master disk (in emulator),
	and de-nibblized version



clean321sysmasstd.d13 & .nib
	Used apple2src to build DOS 3.2.1 onto disk (apple2src/build/dos/dos3X/dos321/dos.d13 & .nib)
	into T$0S$0-T$2S$A (no HELLO program name)
	Built with VERSION=321 and NODELAY
	Valid catalog track $11 (no files, all sectors free except T$0S$0-T$2S$A, T$11)
	zeroes elsewhere (no I/O errors)
	volume #254
	Copied (using Copy ][ Plus 5.5) all files from original DOS 3.2.1 System Master--Standard,
	except for "UPDATE 3.2.1" because that's alread on the Plus disk, below, and because it
	doesn't fit onto a standard volume
	Note that the original Standard disk devotes some of the usused catalog sectors on
	track $11 to storing parts of files; this disk doesn't do that.
	Boots HELLO program.
	(Note: all files are the same as on the 3.2 Standard disk, except HELLO and BRICK OUT.)

clean321sysmaspls.d13 & .nib
	Similar to clean321sysmasstd, but with all files from DOS 3.2.1 System Master--Plus
	(Note: all files are the same as on the 3.2 Plus disk, except HELLO and UPDATE 3.2.1.)
