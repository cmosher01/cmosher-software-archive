  -a - runs all the tests with standard/default options to create a report

  -m multiply_p - multiply default # of psamples in -a(ll) runs to crank
     up the resolution of failure.






  -g generator number - selects a specific generator for testing.  Using
     -1 causes all known generators to be printed out to the display.

  -f filename - generators 201 or 202 permit either raw binary or
     formatted ASCII numbers to be read in from a file for testing.
     generator 200 reads in raw binary numbers from stdin.
     Note well: many tests with default parameters require a lot of rands!
     To see a sample of the (required) header for ASCII formatted input, run

         dieharder -o -f example.input -t 10

     and then examine the contents of example.input.
     Raw binary input reads 32 bit increments of the specified data stream.
     stdin_input_raw accepts a pipe from a raw binary stream.

  -S seed - where seed is a uint.  Overrides the default random seed
     selection.  Ignored for file or stdin input.

  -s strategy - if strategy is the (default) 0, dieharder reseeds (or
     rewinds) once at the beginning when the random number generator is
     selected and then never again.  If strategy is nonzero, the generator
     is reseeded or rewound at the beginning of EACH TEST.  If -S seed was
     specified, or a file is used, this means every test is applied to the
     same sequence (which is useful for validation and testing of dieharder,
     but not a good way to test rngs).  Otherwise a new random seed is
     selected for each test.






  -d test number - selects specific diehard test.

  -l list all known tests.

  -k ks_flag
     0 is fast but slightly sloppy for psamples > 4999 (default).
     1 is MUCH slower but more accurate for larger numbers of psamples.
     2 is very slow and accurate to machine precision.
     3 is kuiper ks, fast, quite inaccurate for small samples, deprecated.

  -n set ntuple length for tests on short bit strings that permit
     the length to be varied (e.g. rgb bitdist).

  -p sets the number of p-value samples per test (default 100).

  -t sets the number of random entities used in each test, where
     possible.  Be warned -- some tests will take a long time with the
     default value of 10000.  Read the test synopses for suggested settings
     for -t or use -a first.  Many tests will ignore -t as they require
     a very specific number of samples to be used in generating their
     statistic.

  -x,-y,-z number - Some tests have parameters that can safely be varied
     from their default value.  For example, in the diehard birthdays test,
     one can vary the number of length, which can also be varied.
     Using -x 2048 -y 30 alters these two values but should still run fine.






  -c table separator - where separator is e.g. ',' (CSV) or ' ' (whitespace).

  -D output flag - permits fields to be selected for inclusion in dieharder
     output.  Each flag can be entered as a binary number that turns
     on a specific output field or header or by flag name; flags are
     aggregated.  To see all currently known flags use the -F command.

  -F lists all known flags by name and number.

  -o filename - output -t count random numbers from current generator to file.






  -h prints context-sensitive help -- usually Usage (this message) or a
     test synopsis if entered as e.g. dieharder -D 3 -h.


  -v verbose flag -- controls the verbosity of the output for debugging
     only.  Probably of little use to non-developers, and developers can
     read the enum(s) in dieharder.h and the test sources to see which
     flag values turn on output on which routines.  1 is 'all' and will
     result in a highly detailed trace of program activity.
