				<h3>Configuration</h3>
				<p>
					The Epple ][ Emulator is most useful when properly configured.
					The primary purpose of the configuration file is to load firmware
					images, and to insert peripheral cards.
				</p>
				<h4>epple2.conf</h4>
				<p>
					The default configuration file for
					the Epple ][ emulator is:
					<ul><li>/etc/epple2/epple2.conf</li></ul>
					or elsewhere depending
					on how the program is packaged for your Linux distribution. For Windows,
					the file will be:
					<ul><li>C:\Program Files\Epple2\etc\epple2\epple2.conf</li></ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					You can specify a different configuration file for the emulator to use by
					specifying its name as the argument when running the epple2 program.
				</p>
				<p>
					The format of the configuration file is just lines of commands. The allowed
					commands are documented on the <a href="commands.shtml">commands</a>
					page. Comments begin with a "#" character and end at the end of the line.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Epple ][ Emulator can actually be run without a configuration file at all.
					In this case, you will be able to "power on" the Apple and see the low-resolution
					graphics display showing random RAM data. The system will not run, because
					there is no firmware loaded, but the emulator will otherwise be functional.
				</p>
				<h4>Firmware</h4>
				<p>
					Firmware, commonly called ROM images or ROMs, will need to be loaded
					into the emulated ROM areas of the emulated Apple
					in order for it to be able to "run" the Apple
					as you know it. The firmware available is described on the
					<a href="download.shtml">download</a> page. Once the firmware image
					files are installed on your computer, you can use the <a href="commands.shtml#import">
					import</a> command to load the image into the emulator.
				</p>
				<h4>Peripheral Cards</h4>
				<p>
					Another primary concern for configuring the Epple ][ is the insertion of
					peripheral cards into the Apple's slots. The most useful card is probably the
					Disk ][ Controller card; you will need to insert one of these cards if you want
					to be able to load floppy disk images into the emulated Apple. The various
					types of cards available are described on the <a href="cards.shtml">peripheral
					cards</a> page, and you will use the <a href="commands.shtml#slot">slot</a>
					command to insert them into the Apple's slots.
				</p>
				<h4>Sample Configuration Files</h4>
				<p>
					There are a number of configuration files provided with the distribution for
					your convenience. They provide various common configurations of machines.
					You can use one of these files directly, by specifying its path as the argument
					to the program, or as a starting point for you own configuration file. These sample files
					are in the same location as the default epple2.conf file.
