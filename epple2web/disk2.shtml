				<h3>Disk ][ Controller Card</h3>
				<p>
					The <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Disk ][</span> Controller card
					emulates the floppy disk controller card and
					associated disk drives in the original <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Apple ][</span>
					systems. In the emulator, each card has
					two drives attached to it, referred to as drive 1 and drive 2. The floppy disks
					themselves are represented by a "nibble" image of the contents. The
					emulator emulates the hardware, but to be of any use, you will need to provide
					the firmware ROM code.
				</p>
				<p>
					To use a disk card and drives, add these lines to your epple2.conf file, for example:
<code><pre>slot 6 disk
import slot 6 rom 0 /usr/lib/apple2/dos3x/16sector/controller/disk2.ex65</pre></code>
					The first line uses the "<a href="commands.shtml#slot">slot</a>" command to
					insert a disk contoller card into slot 6, which is the standard
					slot used for disk cards. The next line uses the "<a href="commands.shtml#import">import</a>"
					command to load the card with the disk controller
					firmware. This firmware is known as the "bootstrap" or "P5" ROM code. It is seen by
					the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Apple ][</span> at memory addresses $Cs00-$CsFF, where s is the slot number (so in
					the common case, the ROM is at $C600-$C6FF). The firmware is copyright by Apple,
					and is available from the <a href="a2library.shtml"><span style="white-space: nowrap;">Apple ][</span> Library</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					You can also "load" a floppy disk image (nibble format) into the drive by using
					the "<a href="commands.shtml#load">load</a>" command in the epple2.conf file,
					or at the command prompt in the
					emulator (F5). For example, you could load the DOS 3.3 system master into
					slot 6, drive 1, with this command:
<code><pre>load slot 6 drive 1 /usr/lib/apple2/dos3x/16sector/disks/dos330/clean330sysmas.nib</pre></code>
