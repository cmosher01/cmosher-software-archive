				<h3>DOS 3.1 System Master on Revision 0 motherboard</h3>
				<p>
					<img class="ss" src="dos310rev0.png" /><br />

					Here we've configured an Apple ][ (Integer BASIC ROMs),
					with a Revision Zero motherboard, and a disk
					controller (with 13-sector ROMs) in slot 6. With a
					revision 0 motherboard, when the machine is powered-on,
					the CPU doesn't start actually running until you
					manually press the RESET button. Also, the old Monitor
					ROMs do not boot from the disk drives automatically;
					you need to type C600G to boot.
					We've booted the DOS 3.1 System Master disk and done a
					catalog of it. As you can see, with a revision 0 motherboard,
					the text is displayed in green and purple, which are also the
					only two HIRES colors. Later revisions
					of the motherboard added a "color burst killer" which is
					active during text mode, so the text would be strictly white.
					Two more HIRES colors, blue and orange, were also added in
					later revisions.
