					Proprietary Apple ROMs are available at the <a href="a2library">Apple ][ Library</a>.

				<h3>Downloading and Installing</h3>
				<h4>Epple ][ Program&mdash;The Hardware (Emulated)</h4>
				<p>
					The Epple ][ Program is the emulator itself, which emulates the
					<span style="white-space: nowrap;">Apple ][</span>
					or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">][ plus</span> <b>hardware</b>, as well as the
					<a href="cards.shtml">peripheral card</a> hardware.
					Download the file for your platform (binary, ready to run), or source if you want to compile
					it yourself (see <a href="building.shtml">Building</a>). For binary downloads, install the package
					as appropriate: for Linux,<br />Redhat <code><pre>sudo rpm -i epple2-1.0-1.i386.rpm</pre></code>
					or Debian<code><pre>sudo dpkg -i epple2_1.0-2_i386.deb</pre></code>
					For Windows, allow the browser to run the <code>epple2-1.0.msi</code> file, or else save it and double-click it.
				</p>
				<h4>System ROMs&mdash;The Main System Firmware (Demo or Real)</h4>
				<p>
					Since the Epple ][ program just emulates hardware, you will also need to download some <b>system software</b>
					for it to run. This is commonly called "firmware" or "ROMs," because it is stored in the
					read-only memory area of the emulated system. The original system software on the
					<span style="white-space: nowrap;">Apple ][</span> machines
					is copyright by Apple, and is proprietary. If you own an actual
					<span style="white-space: nowrap;">Apple ][</span>
					or <span style="white-space: nowrap;">][ plus</span> machine, you
					can copy the firmware from it ($D000-$FFFF) (into a file on your PC) and use it. Alternatively, you can download
					the firmware images from the <a href="a2library">Apple ][ Library</a>. In any case, you must respect the terms
					of the copyright (owned by Apple); this page is not intended to give you any legal advice.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you do not want to download the proprietary firmware, you can still use the emulator (albeit
					in a restricted manner) with the free (GPLv3) <b>"System ROM (Demo)"</b> on this page, above. Download
					the file for your platform and
					install as appropriate. You can choose either binary format (read to run), or source if you want
					to assemble it yourself (using the <a href="http://www.cc65.org/">cc65 Assembler</a>).
					The Demo System ROM only provides commands to dump or set memory bytes,
					or run a program in memory. It is not compatible with any Apple software, nor can it read from disks.
					It's just a free simple demo system to make the emulator do something.
				</p>
				<h4>Card ROMs&mdash;The Peripheral Card Firmware</h4>
				<p>
					If you are going to use the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">Disk ][</span>
					Controller peripheral card (which you almost certainly will, if
					you want to read any floppy disk images), you will need to have to original ROMs from Apple.
					No demo of the Disk ROMs are provided here; you will need to
					use the original ROMs, which can be obtained from an original machine (by copying it
					from $C600-$C6FF into a file on the PC), or from the <a href="a2library">Apple ][ Library</a>.
					In any case, you must respect the terms of the copyright (owned by Apple); this page is not
					intended to give you any legal advice.
					(And, of course, you will need the real Apple System ROM, as noted in the previous section,
					not the Demo System ROM)
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are using the clock, the standard output, or the standard input
					peripheral cards, you will need to
					download their firmware as well, which is provided on this page, above, at <b>"Card ROMs"</b>.
					You can choose either binary format
					(ready to run) or source format (to assemble with the
					<a href="http://www.cc65.org/">cc65 Assembler</a>).
					If you are <i>not</i> going to use the stdin, stdout, or clock
					cards, then you do not need to download this.
				</p>
				<h3>Configuring</h3>
				<p>
					After downloading and installing the Epple ][ Program, some System ROM (demo or real), and
					optionally the peripheral card ROMs you want to use, you will need to configure the program.
					Configuring is concerned primarily with telling the program what peripheral cards to use,
					and where the ROM files are located (and what memory addresses to load them at).
					There is a section that describes in detail how to <a href="configuration.shtml">configure</a>
					the program.
