				<h3>Language Card</h3>
				<p>
					The language card emulates an Apple 16K RAM card, commonly called a Language Card.
					To use a language card, add this line to your epple2.conf file:
				</p>
				<p>
					<code><pre>slot 0 language</pre></code>
				</p>
				<p>
					Note that DOS and ProDOS will make use of a language card only if it is in slot zero.
				</p>
				<p>
					The language card has RAM at addresses $E000 through $FFFF, as well as two banks of RAM
					at addresses $D000 through $DFFF. A program switches between these RAMs and/or the
					motherboard ROM by using the I/O switches at $C080 through $C08F.
				</p>
				<p>
					The information area of the EPPLE ][ will show the current state of the
					language card as follows:
					<table>
						<tbody>
							<tr><td><code>R</code></td><td>Read from card RAM (vs. motherboard ROM)</td></tr>
							<tr><td><code>W</code></td><td>Write to card RAM (vs. write-disabled)</td></tr>
							<tr><td><code>B1</code></td><td>Use $D000 bank 1</td></tr>
							<tr><td><code>B2</code></td><td>Use $D000 bank 2</td></tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
