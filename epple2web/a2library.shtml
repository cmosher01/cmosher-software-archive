<h2>NOTICE: Warning Concerning Copyright Restrictions</h2>
<p>
The copyright law of the United States (title 17, United States 
Code) governs the making of photocopies or other reproductions of 
copyrighted material.
</p>
<p>
Under certain conditions specified in the law, libraries and 
archives are authorized to furnish a photocopy or other reproduction. 
One of these specific conditions is that the photocopy or reproduction 
is <b>not to be "used for any purpose other than private study, 
scholarship, or research."</b> If a user makes a request for, or later 
uses, a photocopy or reproduction for purposes in excess of "fair 
use," that user may be liable for copyright infringement.
</p>
<p>
This institution reserves the right to refuse to accept a copying 
order if, in its judgment, fulfillment of the order would involve 
violation of copyright law.
