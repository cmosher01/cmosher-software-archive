<h3>Apple ][ System Software</h3>
<p>
The Apple ][ and Apple ][ plus computers came with System Software in their
ROM chips from the factory. The System Software is commonly called "firmware,"
or simply "ROMs".
</p>
<p>
The Apple ][ (as opposed to the Apple ][ plus) had the "Monitor" system
firmware, as well as the "Integer BASIC" interpreter and command line shell,
and a few other miscellaneous features, such as "Sweet-16" and the Mini Assembler.
The Apple ][ plus had an
updated Monitor, sometimes known as the "Autostart Monitor," and replaced
Integer BASIC and the misc. routines with a new floating-point BASIC, called
"Applesoft BASIC," which was written by Microsoft (in its early days).
</p>
<h3>Apple ][ Disk Operating System Software</h3>
<p>
The Apple ][ Disk Operating System Software is commonly known as "DOS 3.3".
This software is on most Apple ][ floppy disks, and is loaded into the computer
from the floppy during the "boot" process. The Disk ][ Controller peripheral
card contains some firmware that begins the boot process. The rest of DOS is
stored on the floppy disk. There were different versions of DOS released by
Apple, in two incompatible forms: the earlier with 13 sectors per disk track,
and the later, most common, format, with 16 sectors per track.
</p>
<h3>Recovery Effort</h3>
<p>
These pieces of software are not easily available today, in source or
binary form. The System Software can only be obtained in binary form, and only by
purchasing an actual Apple ][ through private sale (or auction). Some of
the source code was published (in printed form only) in various
reference manuals from Apple, which are also hard to come by. As for the
DOS software, version 3.3 is the most common, but is only available in
binary form, and only through private channels. The older versions of DOS
are almost impossible to find. And none of the DOS source code was ever
made available officially.
</p>
<p>
After years of tireless effort, we have been able to completely recreate all
of the System Software and DOS Software in source form. The source is (highly
commented) 6502 assembly language, intended
for the ca65 Assembler (part of the <a href="http://www.cc65.org/">cc65</a>
C compiler collection), although porting it to other 6502 assemblers
should not be too difficult. Included in the recovery effort was all
System Software for the Apple ][ and ][ plus, including the Monitor and
both BASIC interpreters. Also included were the Disk Operating
System Software versions 3.1, 3.2, 3.2.1, and the three different
releases of version 3.3. The (known) official "System Master" disks were recovered
as well. Also included were the (yet) older versions of Monitor
and Integer BASIC that were provided for the Apple I (one). There was
also an older version of Applesoft that exists (on cassette from Apple),
but we have not (yet) been able to obtain any copy of this, so it has
not been recovered. More details on specific versions are available
in source code comments, and in various README files that also come with
the source distributions.
As stated above, these works are provided for private
study, scholarship, or research only, and are (or may be) copyright by
Apple Inc. or others. We are not lawyers, and are not providing legal advice. For
convenience, these works are also provided in binary form for various platforms
(.rpm for Redhat, .deb for Debian, or .msi for Windows).
