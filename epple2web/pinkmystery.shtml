					Jim Sather's book "Understanding the Apple II," which was the primary
					reference for the internal design of the EPPLE ][ emulator, describes the video
					generation process of the Apple ][, in great detail, in Chapter 8.
					On page 8-21 he shows a simple Applesoft BASIC program (shown below)
					that shows an example of one of the hi-res idiosyncrasies on the Apple ][.
					The program would logically draw three orange lines, but due to the
					video cutoff and extension of half-dot shifted pixels, instead the right
					line is brown, and there is a "mysterious pink line" (actually magenta)
					on the far left of the screen. The EPPLE ][ faithfully emulates this behavior.
