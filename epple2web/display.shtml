				<h3>Epple ][ Display</h3>
				The orignal Apple ][s didn't come with a display. The user needed to use either a standard
				television or a monitor to see the computer's output. The EPPLE ][ emulates a variety of
				displays; you can cycle between the different types using F2.
				There are two major types of displays: televisions and monitors. Monitors generally have
				higher quality (sharper) displays.
				The displays show the normal visible area of the
				NTSC video signal generated by the emulated Apple ][ machine.
				<h2>Monitors</h2>
				The emulator provides a color monitor, and three monochrome monitors (white, green, and orange).
				These emulate standard, no-frills NTSC monitors. The most noticable characteristic of monitors
				is the horizontal display of pixels. Monitors react faster than TVs, so two adjacent pixels will
				not merge together; both will be distinctly visible, with blackness between them.
				<h2>Televisions</h2>
				There are two types of television displays, referred to as "old" and "new." Each has color and
				monochrome (commonly known as "black and white") varieties. Televisions react more slowly to
				changes in the incoming video signal,  and as a result, horizontal pixels will merge together,
				forming a more uniform appearance.
				The "new" color TV display uses the pre-defined
				color pallette (described below under "Colors"), and the black and white TV uses the same
				colors, but fully desaturated. The "old" color TV is the most interesting. It emulates the
				signal decoing circuitry of a television. This includes separating out the "chroma" portion
				of the incoming video signal using a filter algorithm, and calculating the color to display.
				It doesn't use the pre-defined colors (described below under "Colors"). This mode is very CPU
				intensive, so your computer (that is, the one that EPPLE ][ is running on) may not be able to
				run fast enough to emulate the original Apple ]['s speed. The Apple ][s CPU runs at about
				1 MHz, but the video generator runs at 14 MHz; so the inner-most loop in the EPPLE ][ must
				run 14 million times per second to keep up. The most noticable characteristics of the old TV
				display is that it appears blurry, and that the color brown appears more like green.
				<h3>Colors</h3>
				The color palatte used for the
				color monitor and old color TV is pre-defined, and was determined through observation of a real
				Apple ][ machine on a standard TV, the colors being matched by eye. The old color TV, however,
				uses algorithms to calculate the colors it displays.
				<h3>Scan Lines</h3>
				NTSC displays (TVs or monitors) usually receive signals that are interlaced. However, the
				Apple ][ doesn't generate interlaced screens. This causes blank rows between each displayed
				row of pixels. The EPPLE ][ emulates this behavior, but also allows you to "fill in" these
				black rows with a copy of the row above it, for a more continuous display (vertically). Use
				the F4 key to toggle between these two modes.
				<h3>Resolution</h3>
				The Apple ][s are commonly documented as having a resolution of 280x192 pixels, and to an
				extent this is true. Vertically there are 192 pixels, but since there is no interlacing,
				it is more accurate to display them with one blank space between each. So the EPPLE ][ has
				two times 192, or 384, vertical pixels in its display. Horizontally there are 280 pixels, but
				each could also be shifted right one-half dot, allowing for two times 280, or 560, different
				horizontal displayable positions. To emulate this, the EPPLE ][ shows each emulated pixel as
				two pixels wide, and displays an emulated half-dot shift as an actual one pixel shift. So the
				display area of the EPPLE ][ is 560x384. There is an informational area below and to the
				right of the emulated display that shows various statistics of the emulator. So the total screen
				area used by the EPPLE ][ is a standard 640x480 pixels.
				<h3>Full Screen</h3>
				The EPPLE ][ can run in either full-screen mode, or within a window. Use the F3 key to toggle
				between the two.
